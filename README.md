 # DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED 
KisanConnect is an AI-based farming support platform that provides farmers with quick and reliable agricultural information.
It organizes crop-wise details in a structured manner, helping users understand plantation methods, soil and climate requirements, irrigation needs, and pest or disease management.
The system also offers weather updates, market and government scheme information, along with an interactive chatbot for instant guidance.
By delivering essential knowledge in one place, KisanConnect aims to make farming easier, smarter, and more productive.


 # PROBLEM STATEMENT
Farmers today face challenges due to fragmented and delayed access to reliable agricultural information. 
Most existing advisory services are manual, region-limited, or offer static content that does not address real-time needs such as weather changes, pest outbreaks, or market fluctuations.
Many digital platforms lack integration, providing only partial information on crops, fertilizers, or government schemes, and often fail to support local languages.
This results in inefficient farming decisions, crop losses, lower productivity, and financial instability.
There is a clear need for a unified, intelligent, and accessible system that consolidates crop guidance, weather updates, market insights, scheme details, and 
disease management, providing personalized and timely support to farmers for better decision-making and improved agricultural outcomes.
